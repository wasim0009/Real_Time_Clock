   - Create a sleek digital clock interface.
   - Update the time dynamically with JavaScript.
   - Implement a smooth transition for time updates.

🎨 **Styling:**
   - Add stylish CSS to enhance the visual appeal.
   - Consider using CSS animations for subtle effects.

📏 **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the clock layout adapts to various screen sizes.
   - Implement a mobile-friendly design for users on the go.

⏰ **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Use JavaScript's `setInterval` function to update the clock in real-time.
   - Provide a seamless experience with smooth transitions.

🎁 **Bonus Features:**
   - **Time Format Toggle:** Allow users to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
   - **Time Zone Support:** Implement an option to display the time in different time zones.
